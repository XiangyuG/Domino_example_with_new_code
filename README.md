# Domino_example_with_new_code
These are files with same meaning but different compilation results. For current files, the filename with _fail is those which fails to compile. In this case, 4,5,6 are files with failure
This time, I use the atom pair(pair_modified_pkt4.sk) with a slight change(including pkt_3 and pkt_4) compared with pair.sk. 
I make a small change of our domino compile to include pkt_3 and pkt_4. I put both sketch_backend_origin and sketch_backend in repository so as to compare them more easily.
